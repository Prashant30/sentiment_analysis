A basic sentiment analysis of the posts collected from online to train and test a simple neural network. It uses 12 different types of sentiments taken. Brief details of those emotions are as follows:

I have given enough detail in code about the model and training and testing. It is a ipynb file, feel free to execute in whichever IDE you like, I have used google colab for the same.
Please note that because of copyright issues, I cannot share the full training or testing dataset. I can share a snippet of it which can be found in a separate folder named "data". 
Feel free to change the code and commit but please do not change the file reading part while committing.
